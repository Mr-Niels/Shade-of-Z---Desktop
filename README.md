# Shade Z - Desktop Theme

This is a fork of Zorin OS Desktop theme(s) and is modified by me. It adds opacity to the GTK theme and Gnome-shell menus.
XFCE is now supported (Aimed for Lite version of Zorin OS 16 when it gets released). NOTE: XFCE support still needs a lot of work, so don't get disapointed.
